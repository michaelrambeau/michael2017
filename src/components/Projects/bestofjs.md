### Concept

[bestof.js.org](http://bestof.js.org/about) gathers every day the latest trends about open source projects related to node.js and the web platform: JavaScript of course , client and server side, but also html, css...

### Background: why bestof.js.org?

Javascript, HTML and CSS are advancing faster than ever, we are going fullspeed on innovation.
Amazing open-source projects are released almost everyday, so it's hard to keep up-to-date about the trends.

This is why I build [bestof.js.org](http://bestof.js.org/), I wanted a way to check every easily the most relevant projects.

In addition, I wanted to keep on learning about the latest technologies and the good practices, building a **real-world** application.
