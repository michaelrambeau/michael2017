I have been building intranet and web applications with enthusiasm and commitment since 2000.

I came to Japan in 2010, I worked for 3 different companies, in 3 very different environments:

* From 2011 to 2014, I was in charge of the web site of a money transfer service: [BrastelRemit](http://brastelremit.jp/home), in a multi-cultural environment.
* From 2014 to 2016, I worked on the UI/UX of a Customer Postal at [FirstServer](https://www.firstserver.co.jp/). a web hosting company where I was the only foreigner.
* Since 2016, I have been working on a web application built on top of Meteor framework (JavaScript everywhere!): [shipandco.com](https://www.shipandco.com/)

I am ready to take the next step and help you build together the next big thing!
