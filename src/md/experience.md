I have been building intranet and web applications with enthusiasm and commitment since 2000.

I came to Japan in 2010, I worked for 5 different companies, in very different environments:

- From 2011 to 2014, I was in charge of the web site of a money transfer service: [BrastelRemit](http://brastelremit.jp/home), in a multi-cultural environment.
- From 2014 to 2016, I worked on the UI/UX of a Customer Postal at [FirstServer](https://www.firstserver.co.jp/). a web hosting company where I was the only foreigner.
- From 2016 to 2018, I worked on a web application built on top of Meteor framework (full-stack JavaScript): [Shipandco](https://www.shipandco.com/)
- In 2018, I worked for [Pactera Technology Japan](https://en.pactera.com/) doing code review and teaching good practices about modern web development with React.
- In 2019 I joined [Medmain](https://medmain.com/), a startup in the medicine field that uses AI to provide diagnosis. I design and develop web applications made with React.

I am ready to take the next step, contact me if you are in interested in my skills and in my experience.
